thy-world
---

a game maker that uses thy-game under the hood

thy-game is based on a an entity component system, and graphics are rendered with divs positioned explicitly, and not a canvas

this is done to simplify the code, the idea is being easy to use and accessible to beginner programmers

thy-game does not intend to be able to implement any sort of game, 3D games are out of scope for example
